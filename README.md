R-Analytics
The Spotify trend analysis using R focuses on uncovering patterns in music streams, artist contributions, and track releases through data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization. Key steps include removing duplicates, handling missing values, and summarizing data to analyze total, average, and maximum streams. Insights are drawn on top artists, tracks, and collaboration impacts, revealing that single-artist tracks often dominate streams, though specific collaborations perform well. Visualizations such as line plots, histograms, and heatmaps highlight trends in streams, seasonal track releases, and playlist performance. The analysis underscores the importance of playlists, newer releases, and strategic collaborations in driving streaming success, offering valuable insights for artists and producers.
